# K_means-Segmentation

Cluster 1 : Typical Clients
This group has an average income and purchases an average number of goods. The majority of them participate in only one campaign, but when there is a discount, they make further purchases. They are more likely than the other two groups to shop online.
Cluster 2: Customers with Low Income and Low Engagement
This client segment has the smallest purchasing power and spends very little with this organisation. Almost none of them take part in a campaign. They prefer, however, to go to the homepage of the online store.
Cluster 3: Customers with a High-Income and High-Spending Profile
The third category, in contrast to the second, has the highest income and purchase history. Customers in this cluster are more likely to have small families, accept more campaigns, and prefer to shop in stores or through catalogues. They don't go to the shop's website very often, yet they nevertheless make a significant quantity of online purchases. Furthermore, the discount is unappealing to them.


It's worth mentioning that the second group has the largest client base, with around half of all customers falling into this category. The size of the other two groups is similar.
